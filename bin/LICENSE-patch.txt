AUTHORS
       Larry  Wall  wrote  the  original version of patch.  Paul Eggert removed patch's
       arbitrary limits; added support for binary files, setting file times, and delet‐
       ing  files;  and  made  it  conform better to POSIX.  Other contributors include
       Wayne Davison, who added unidiff support, and David MacKenzie, who added config‐
       uration and backup support.  Andreas Grünbacher added support for merging.
